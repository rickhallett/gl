        Codility was a very unpleasant experience. It's error messages during
        development threw me off course about 100 times, so I decided to
        implement the solutions again here. I cannot quite remember the grid
        challenge, so I made something approximating it. Thank you for your time
        and consideration.

        The solution isn't perfect, and there are some known bugs, but I don't
        want to dedicate too much time in case it isn't considered!
